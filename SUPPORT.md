# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using a project? Here's how.

## How to get help

Please seek support in the following ways:

1- :book: **Read the docs**. First things first: Check the repository's `README.md` and other `*.md` files on the `/docs` folder. At 42dx we try to provide a quick start guide for every project on its `README.md` file and, when applicable, a deeper/more detailed guide on `/docs`.

2- :family: **Reach out for the community**. Did not find what your looking for? try searching/asking on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), specially when dealing with usage questions that are not specific to the project itself. By doing so, you are more likely to quickly solve your problem, and you will allow anyone else with the same question to find the answer. This also allows maintainers to focus on improving the project for others.

3- :memo: **Open a discussion**. You can also open a discussion (remember: `discussions != issues`) on the `discussion` tab of the relevant repository. Although we encourage you to do so, remember that we still are a pretty smal opensource org, so your issue would probably be answered faster if help is sought in more popular venues.

We will do our best to keep track of any doubts, concearns, difficulties brought up by the community, and constantly improve our documentations :v:

## What *NOT* to do

Please **do not** do any the following:

- :x: Do not reach out authors or contributors any social media.
- :x: Do not email the author or contributor.
- :x: Do not open duplicate issues or litter an existing issue with +1's.

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an open-source project. Please follow the guidelines in the previous section. Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone in the community ✌️

Plus: remember that all 42dx's projects are open source, and the development is fuelled only by love (so far). Our contributors do their best to improve our projects and help the community, but, unfortunately, love alone do not pay the bills :sweat_smile:

## Customer Support

It is not possible to 42dx to provide any direct customer support. Please rely on discussions on our repositories if you need any specific/particular help. And be patient :wink:
