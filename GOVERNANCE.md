## Values

42dx and its leadership embrace the following values:

- **Openness**: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public forums and open repositories.

- **Fairness**: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit contributions, which will be considered on their merits.

- **Community over Product or Company**: Sustaining and growing our community takes priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals. Each contributor participates in the project as an individual.

- **Inclusivity**: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.

- **Participation**: Responsibilities within the project are earned through participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership positions.

## Owners

42dx's Owners have write access to all repositories withing the Org's namespace, and only them can add/remove Maintainers.

## Maintainers

42dx's Maintainers have write access to relevant repositories under the Org's namespace. They can merge their own patches or patches from others. The current maintainers
can be found in each repo's CODEOWNERS file. Maintainers collectively manage the project's resources and contributors.

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers are people who care about the project(s) they own and want to help it grow and improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and follow through to fix issues (in code or tests).

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping the project succeed.

The collective team of all Maintainers is known as the Maintainer Council, which is the governing body for the project.

### Becoming a Maintainer

To become a Maintainer you need to demonstrate the following:

- Commitment to the project:
  - Participate in discussions, contributions, code and documentation reviews for 3 months or more
  - Perform (relevant) reviews for 15 non-trivial pull requests
  - Contribute with 5 non-trivial pull requests and have them merged
- Ability to write quality code and/or documentation
- Ability to collaborate with the team
- Understanding of how the team works (policies, processes for testing and code review, etc)
- Understanding of the project's code base and coding and documentation style

A new Maintainer must be proposed by an existing maintainer by opening a discussion on the relevant repository `discussions` tab. A simple majority vote of existing Maintainers approves the application. Maintainers nominations will be evaluated without prejudice at all.

Maintainers who are selected will be granted the necessary GitHub rights.

### Removing a Maintainer

Maintainers may resign at any time if they feel that they will not be able to (or do not want to) continue fulfilling their project duties.

Maintainers may also be removed after being inactive, failure to fulfill their Maintainer responsibilities, violating the Code of Conduct, or other reasons. 

Inactivity is defined as a period of very low or no activity in the project for a year or more, with no definite schedule to return to full Maintainer activity.

A Maintainer may be removed at any time by a 2/3 vote of the remaining maintainers.

Depending on the reason for removal, a Maintainer may be converted to Emeritus status. Emeritus Maintainers will still be consulted on some project matters, and can be rapidly returned to Maintainer status if their availability changes.

## Code of Conduct

[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/42dx/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) violations by community members will be discussed internally and resolved. If a Maintainer is directly involved in the report, the ofender will not participate on the discussion.

## Security Response Team

The Maintainers are also the Security Response Team. If any Security report is filed, according to our [security policy](https://github.com/42dx/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md), solving it becomes the relevant repo's maintainers priority number one.

## Projects

All projects under 42dx are subject to the same policies (rare exception may apply):

- [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/42dx/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/42dx/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [SECURITY](https://github.com/42dx/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
- [SUPPORT](https://github.com/42dx/.github/blob/main/SUPPORT.md)
- [GOVERNANCE](https://github.com/42dx/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)

### Inactive Projects

In some cases, projects will become inactive or unmaintainable. In those cases, it is maintainers's responsability to discuss, understand what is happening with it and, if a consensus is reached, **archive** (never delete) the repository. A nome must be done on the top of the `README.md` stating that the project is no longer maintained and the reasons.

## Final Thoughts

This document was concieved in a moment that 42dx is just a small org with just a few projects. The way things are handled may eventually change, considering the growth of the projects and the org itself.
